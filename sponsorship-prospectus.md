About us
=======
Adelaide Blockchain is a student run, multi-university and interdisciplinary Blockchain organisation based in Adelaide, Australia. Our organisation's initiative is dedicated to engage and educate students and our ever expanding ecosystem about Blockchain and Web 3.0 technology. We collectively believe these technologies will fundamentally disrupt many aspects of the global economy. By encouraging education, collaboration and providing consultation not only locally with students, universities, incubators and venture initiatives, but also at the national and international scale, we wish to contribute to the movement towards a distributed economy.

In order to truly develop this vision, we believe partnering with your initiative, to learn from your experience, knowledge, network and mentorship will be pivotal to our success. By running meetups, workshops, boot camps, hackathons, conferences and more, we believe our organisation has built a strong ecosystem, which has an unique ability to engage local talent networks, building minimum viable skillsets, conducting R&D and supporting reputable initiatives in the industry just like your's.

Events
=======
Adelaide Blockchain seeks to integrate the community through 3 main channels: workshops and courses, meetups, bootcamps and hackathons.

### 1. Workshops and courses ###

We aim to cater to wide range of knowledge and skills. With that perspective, our workshops and courses are our key priority to equip individuals with a minimum viable skillset to interface with the industry. We envision creating two 6-part series courses, described below, about Blockchain technology starting August 2018 to achieve this goal. 

#### 1.A Code development ####
This course will be based on familiarising with basic Blockchain concepts, fundamentals and code libraries. Topics discussed will also include; in depth education on Ethereum nomenclature, smart contracts, security, token standards, virtual machine, and other topics that include the Lightning network and scalability.

#### 1.B Blockchain theory ####
This course will be geared towards those without a technological background.  Topics discussed will explore Blockchain’s inherent strengths and weaknesses, token economics and incentivization, practical use cases and an introduction to Blockchain start-up marketing and business strategy, and ICOs.
Workshops will complement the lecture series to enable a more hands-on and collaborative approach.

### 2. Meetups ###

We believe monthly meetups are the best way our organisation engages general interest about Blockchain technology in the Adelaide community. During our meetup events we present on recent trending news in the space and bring knowledgeable people to guide discussion that benefits everyone. Additionally, we use our discord group to gauge key interest areas and member queries in between meetups that may be good discussion points during events. This approach seeks to encourage enduring conversation. 

### 3. Bootcamps and Hackathons ###

To further foster Adelaide Blockchain’s community, especially students, we plan to run Blockathons (Blockchain + Hackathon) and bootcamps, incorporating talent from diverse fields to come together, collaborate and strategize solutions to identified issues. We hope this will create an ecosystem that will bootstrap individuals with the ethos of distributed contribution. 

Budget
=======
We have created a tiered outline for our budget; the structure prioritises expenditure to ensure the minimum cost for running organisation is accounted for. 

Tier 1 outlines the proposed costs to sustain our organisation. Tier 2 & 3 are aspirational goals that we believe will assist in facilitating our vision within the global Blockchain community. We understand as a new organisation that establishing our fundamental organisation is a priority, however, all additional funding in the Tier 2 and 3 sectors will only add value to our community. 

Tier 2 & 3 funds will aim to fund influencers and industry professionals to come and share their knowledge, and also endeavour to send our most talented committee members to key international Blockchain conferences.
